# Coding

At this point you should have a good handle on the contribution workflow after completing the previous exercises.

For developer peeps, this exercise allows you to play around and contribute code.

The code you'll be looking at is written in Python. Don't worry if you have little to no experience with Python. You should be able to look at the code in question and get an idea of what's happening.

### Instructions

Take a look at the `py` folder in the top-level. It should have some Python functions in standalone files. Some work, some may have been written under an extreme lack of sleep.

Your mission is to fix the broken code and if you feel brave, add your own new functions.
